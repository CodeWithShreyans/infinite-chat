This project is an AI chatbot application built with Next.js and the AI SDK. It provides a sophisticated chat interface with various features including authentication, file uploads, AI model integration, and persistent data storage.

## Key Technologies

- **Next.js**: The application is built with Next.js App Router for server-side rendering and routing
- **AI SDK**: Unified API for generating text and working with various LLM providers (xAI, OpenAI, etc.)
- **Authentication**: Uses Auth.js (NextAuth) for authentication
- **Database**: Uses Vercel Postgres/Neon (via Drizzle ORM) for data persistence
- **File Storage**: Vercel Blob for storing uploaded files
- **UI**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS for styling
